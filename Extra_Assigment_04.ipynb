        "\n",
        "Jacobi's method iteratively reduces off-diagonal elements of a symmetric matrix to zero. However, due to numerical effects, previously eliminated off-diagonal elements may reappear, requiring many iterations for full convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "To accelerate convergence, we first reduce the matrix to tridiagonal form before applying Jacobi's method. This reduction preserves certain off-diagonal zeros throughout the iterations, improving efficiency.\n",

        "## **Tasks**\n",

        "### (i) Implement Tridiagonal Reduction\n",
        "- Write a Python script that first reduces a given symmetric matrix to tridiagonal form before applying Jacobi's method. Consider implementing Householder reduction.\n",
        "- Verify that your script correctly maintains the structure of a tridiagonal matrix throughout the iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### (ii) Compare Performance Using Iteration Count\n",

        "1. Implement both:\n",
        "   - The **standard Jacobi method**.\n",
        "   - The **tridiagonalized Jacobi method** (applying tridiagonal reduction first).\n",
        "2. Set the convergence criterion discussed in class (Jacobi's notes, *Section 2.2.3*)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Generate a sequence of random symmetric matrices of size $N \\times N$ and test both scripts. Count the number of iterations required for each method to meet the convergence criteria.\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### (iii) Analyze and Discuss Results\n",
        "- Compare how the number of iterations scales with $N$.\n",
        "- Does tridiagonal reduction significantly speed up convergence?\n",
        "- How does the efficiency improvement change for large matrices?\n",
        "- Verify eigenvalues using `numpy.linalg.eigh()`.\n",
        "- Extend the analysis by plotting the decay of the sum of squared off-diagonal elements over iterations."
